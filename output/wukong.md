He learns incredible magical abilities and even storms the **Heavenly Palace**, challenging the gods and causing chaos. As punishment, he's imprisoned under a mountain for **500 years**. Later, he joins the monk **Tang Sanzang** on a pilgrimage to India for Buddhist scriptures, along with other companions, on a perilous journey westward. They face **81 trials**, battling demons and overcoming obstacles.

- **72 Transformations:** He can change into almost any form, like birds, insects, or even people.
- **Somersault Cloud:** A magical cloud that lets him travel vast distances in a single leap (over **108,000 li**, or about **54,000 miles**).
- **Golden Cudgel:** His expandable weapon, which can grow from the size of a needle to a massive staff.
- **Near-Immortality:** After eating immortal peaches and pills, he becomes incredibly strong and hard to kill.
